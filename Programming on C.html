<font size="5"><p><pre><b>       C language was developed in early 1970 by Danny Ritchie at Bell Laboratories.C has become one of the most popular<br>
programming languages today.It is highly structured programming language that is easy to understand and use.In the past,<br>
it was mainly used for writing system program such as operating systems, compilers, assemblers, etc.Today it is used for<br>
writing all types of application programs as well such as word-processing programs, spreadsheet programs, database <br>
management systems, educational programs, games etc.</p>
<p><b><pre>      C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup also at Bell Laboratories during 1983-1985. C++  is a superset of C,<br>
 meaning that any valid C program is also a valid C ++ program. The purpose of developing C++ was to provide programming<br>
 facilities to easily and quickly write more powerful programs.<br></p></b></pre>
